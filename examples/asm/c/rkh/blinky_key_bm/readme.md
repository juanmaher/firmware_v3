# Blinky with keys for EDUCIAA over RKH (barematal)

This example demotrastes eight state machines working in parallel running on RKH framework.

Four of them are different instances for the same LED class and the other four are instances of the KEY class.

Each time the user presses a key the pulsation time is recorded, and the LED associated with the key, changes its blinking pattern.
